This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <description>_
      *Dialog* is a program that will let you present a variety of questions or
       display messages using dialog boxes from a shell script.   These  types
       of  dialog  boxes  are  implemented  (though  not  all  are necessarily
       compiled into dialog):

            >  buildlist, calendar, checklist, dselect, editbox, form, fselect,
            >  gauge, infobox, inputbox, inputmenu, menu, mixedform,
            >  mixedgauge, msgbox (message), passwordbox, passwordform, pause,
            >  prgbox, programbox, progressbox, radiolist, rangebox, tailbox,
            >  tailboxbg, textbox, timebox, treeview, and yesno (yes/no).

       You can put more than one dialog box into a script:

       * Use the "--and-widget" token to force dialog to proceed to the next
           dialog unless you have pressed ESC to cancel, or

       * Simply  add  the  tokens  for  the next dialog box, making a chain.
           Dialog stops chaining  when  the  return  code  from  a  dialog  is
           nonzero, e.g., Cancel or No (see DIAGNOSTICS).

       Some  widgets,  e.g.,  checklist,  will  write text to dialog's output.
       Normally that is the standard error, but there are options for changing
       this:  "--output-fd", "--stderr" and "--stdout".  No text is written if
       the Cancel button (or ESC) is pressed; dialog exits immediately in that
       case.
